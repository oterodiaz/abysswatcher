#+title: AbyssWatcher

AbyssWatcher lets you run any program or script after the system's theme changes. You can use it to change themes in programs that don't respect system settings, such as Vim, Emacs, or even your shell prompt or terminal colorscheme!

The gif below shows AbyssWatcher in action, running [[./sample-script.sh][a simple shell script]] that [[https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier][sends a notification]] every time the theme changes.

* Installation
AbyssWatcher works from macOS Mojave (10.14) onwards.

You can find a precompiled universal binary for Intel and Apple Silicon Macs on the releases page. Alternatively, refer to the /Build/ section for instructions on how to compile it yourself.

Once you have the binary, place it in an appropriate directory such as ~/usr/local/bin~ or =~/.local/bin=, making sure that it is in your ~PATH~.

You should also make the file executable:
#+begin_src shell
chmod +x abysswatcher
#+end_src

When you run the program for the first time, you might see a popup window saying that the app can't run because it wasn't signed by an identified developer. This happens because the app hasn't been signed, and you can run it anyway by going to "System Settings.app -> Privacy and Security", scroll towards the bottom and click "Allow Anyway" in the "Security" section.

Refer to the section /Running AbyssWatcher as a Service/ for further instructions.

* Usage
Run AbyssWatcher with the path to a script as an argument.
#+begin_src shell
abysswatcher /path/to/your/script
#+end_src

If your script needs arguments, pass them normally:
#+begin_src shell
abysswatcher /path/to/your/script --argument
#+end_src

The script will be run directly *after* the system's theme has changed. The ~DARK_MODE~ environment variable will made available to the script when in dark mode (/i.e./ theme changed from light to dark), but it will instead be unset when in light mode. Take a look at [[./sample-script.sh][this POSIX shell script]] for an example on how to detect this.

This program works best as a background service. See the section /Running AbyssWatcher as a Service/ to learn how to do that.

* Running AbyssWatcher as a Service
You will need to place the file [[./com.oterodiaz.abysswatcher.plist][com.oterodiaz.abysswatcher.plist]] in =~/Library/LaunchAgents=. However, some parts of this file are placeholders, as they depend on your computer's settings. First, clone this repository:
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/oterodiaz/abysswatcher.git
cd abysswatcher
#+end_src

Set a temporary environment variable with the path to the script you want AbyssWatcher to run. Due to a limitation in how ~launchd~ services work, if you write the path as a string (between double or single quotes), *make sure to write the full path*: ~/Users/your_username/...~ instead of =~=.
#+begin_src shell
export PATH_TO_USER_SCRIPT=/path/to/your/script
#+end_src

Substitute the placeholders in the ~.plist~ file:
#+begin_src shell
sed -i".bak" "s|ABYSSWATCHER_PATH|$(which abysswatcher)|" com.oterodiaz.abysswatcher.plist
sed -i".bak" "s|PATH_TO_USER_SCRIPT|$PATH_TO_USER_SCRIPT|" com.oterodiaz.abysswatcher.plist
sed -i".bak" "s|SUBSTITUTE_PATH|$PATH|" com.oterodiaz.abysswatcher.plist
rm -f com.oterodiaz.abysswatcher.plist.bak
#+end_src

Copy the file to the appropriate directory:
#+begin_src shell
cp com.oterodiaz.abysswatcher.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
#+end_src

Load the service (It'll run instantly and automatically when you log in):
#+begin_src shell
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.oterodiaz.abysswatcher.plist
#+end_src

If you later modify the file, you'll either need to reboot or unload and load the service again. Here's how to unload it:
#+begin_src shell
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.oterodiaz.abysswatcher.plist
#+end_src

*** Passing Arguments to the Script
If your script needs arguments, you'll have to modify the service file in =~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.oterodiaz.abysswatcher.plist= to add a line for each individual argument directly below your script path, as follows:
#+begin_example
<key>ProgramArguments</key>
<array>
    <string>abysswatcher</string>
    <string>/path/to/your/script</string>
    <string>--script-argument1</string>
    <string>--script-argument2</string>
</array>
#+end_example

*** Passing Additional Environment Variables to the Script
By default, your script will have access to a snapshot of your ~PATH~ environment variable at the time of the service file creation. To update the ~PATH~ or add additional environment variables you'll have to edit the service file like was mentioned in the previous subsection, but this time focusing on the ~EnvironmentVariables~ dictionary towards the bottom of the file. In the example, an additional ~SCRIPTS~ environment variable is passed, which contains the path to the user's scripts directory.
#+begin_example
<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
<dict>
    <key>PATH</key>
    <string>SUBSTITUTE_PATH</string>
    <key>SCRIPTS</key>
    <string>/Users/username/.scripts</string>
</dict>
#+end_example

* Build
You will need to have Xcode installed, along with the Xcode Command Line Tools. Xcode can be downloaded from [[https://apps.apple.com/es/app/xcode/id497799835][the Mac App Store]], while the latter can be installed by running the following command:
#+begin_src shell
xcode-select --install
#+end_src

Then clone this repository:
#+begin_src shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/oterodiaz/abysswatcher.git
cd abysswatcher
#+end_src

And compile the program with the ~swift~ command:
#+begin_src shell
swift build -c release
#+end_src

The resulting binary will be located in ~.build/release/abysswatcher~.

*** Universal Binary
The above instructions compile a binary for your Mac's native architecture, but it is possible to compile a universal binary that works both on Intel and Apple Silicon by running the following command instead:
#+begin_src shell
swift build -c release --arch arm64 --arch x86_64
#+end_src

This time, the file will be located in a different directory: ~.build/apple/Products/Release/abysswatcher~.

/Note: You can run the/ ~file~ /command on the binary to check whether it is universal:/
#+begin_src shell
file abysswatcher
#+end_src
